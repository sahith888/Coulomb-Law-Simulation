# Coulomb-Law-Simulation
Using some basic SIMD shader programming and basic physics to describe how to point bodies attracted to each other would act in a confined box!
Sorry it contains a bunch of other garbage.
In the future I will upload the final code which will provide a basic general purpose shading language accelerated with SIMD.

Couloumbs law is just the definition that between to charged particles the force of attraction is proportional to k(q1q2)/r^2. in This simulation you will see two circles which represent points that both have a charge of magnitude 1. Its apparent that these points are attracted based on coulumbs as they accelerate much faster towards each when close. If You wait long enough you may even see them stat orbiting each other! :)
